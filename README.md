This repository contains only the codes wrotten in JavaScript to process Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 images to generate optical and radar vegetation indices.

My dissertation was written in the Department of Agricultural Engineering, at the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa, Brazil. From that, two scientific papers were derived from, which are:

It is the first paper:

Vegetation cover monitoring in tropical regions using SAR-C dual-polarization index: seasonal and spatial influences. It was published at International Journal of Remote Sensing, and can be accessed through the DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2021.1959955

It is the second paper:

A Machine Learning approach to reconstruct cloudy affected vegetation indices imagery via data fusion from Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8. It was published at Computers and Electronics in Agriculture journal, and can be accessed through the DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.106753
